# Course

The course shell is made up of three importarnt parts: creator information, course media (welcome video and thumbnail) and course summary. To create a course, you will need to provide each of those three pieces.

But don't worry, the creator information is already in the system and will be autofilled. This leaves you with just the other two pieces which we will walk your through.

If the video hasn't completed uploading, or you haven't selected a video, a popup will once again ask you to complete this step before moving on.
